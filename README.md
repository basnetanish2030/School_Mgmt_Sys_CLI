# School Management System

This School Management System is a straightforward Ruby application that simplifies student record management for educational institutions. This program allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records, facilitating efficient and organized school administration.

## Features

- **Add Student:** Easily input a new student's name, class, roll number, address, and contact details. The system validates the data and stores it in a PostgreSQL database for secure and persistent records.
- **Display Students:** View a comprehensive list of all enrolled students and their respective information. This feature provides quick access to student details for administrative purposes.
- **Edit Student:** Authorized users can modify a student's address and contact information. The changes are instantly updated in the database, ensuring real-time data integrity.
- **Delete Student:** Remove a student's record from the database based on their unique ID. This feature promotes data accuracy and keeps the system up-to-date.
